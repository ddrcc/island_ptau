# island_ptau
R code for ISLAND ptau analysis

This is a repository for access of the r scripts used to write the analysis on ISLAND (ISLAND Study Linking Ageing and Neurodegenerative Disease). The intention of this script is to provide transparent and open access to the tools used in the regression models. 

This is a collaboration of researchers at the Wicking Dementia Centre. For any questions, or to enquire about data access please contact eddy.roccati@utas.edu.au.
